eZ Publish 4 (Referred to as `legacy` in eZ Publish 5.x)
========================================================

This repo is now deprecated, since the official repo for eZ Publish Legacy started
to receive updates again, starting with [version 2017.08.0](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-legacy/releases/tag/v2017.08.0).

Since version 2017.08.0 of the official repo is compatible with eZ kernel 6.11 and
later, you can still use this repo with previous versions of eZ kernel, but it will
not receive any more updates. Due to that, it is strongly recommended to upgrade
your installations to eZ kernel 6.11 and later and eZ Publish Legacy 2017.08 and later.
